# Morse-Decoder-using-Basys3
In this project, I will be writing a morse decoder module that displays a morse
equivalent in Ascii on the seven segment display found in the Basys 3 and on its
LEDs. The project will be implemented using one module. The module would
translate the button press as either a dash or a dot depending on the length it was
pressed, determine if a valid button press was made by the user, and would turn
on/off the LEDs based on the input and would also change the seven segment
display.
